# mplab-usb-host-msd
USB Host Mass Storage Device test code for SAME70 / SAME54 / SAMD21 dev boards

This probject implements the test application described in [Create your first USB Host Application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb/wiki/Create-your-first-usb-host-msd-application).  In its own words:

> The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a MPLAB® Harmony 3 project that uses the MPLAB® Harmony File System to create a file on a USB Mass Storage Device (eg: USB Pen Drive). The application will provide a LED indication when the file create process has completed.

This repository contains three [MPLAB.X](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) [Harmony 3](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/configure/mplab-harmony) projects, one each for the [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/DM320113), the [SAM E54 Xplained Pro evaluation kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ATSAME54-XPRO) and the [SAM D21 Xplained Pro evaluation kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/atsamd21-xpro).  The higher level code is shared among the three projects.
